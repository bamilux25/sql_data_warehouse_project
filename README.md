# 🏢 Data Warehouse Project

Building an accurate modern data warehouse involving ETL processes, data modelling, data architecture, and analytics.

---

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **robust, modern data warehouse** designed to enable insightful reporting and informed decision-making. By integrating data from multiple sources and applying best practices in data engineering, this warehouse serves as a foundation for enterprise-level analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to:

- **Build a Modern Data Warehouse** - Create a scalable and efficient data warehouse architecture from a contemporary perspective
- **Ensure Data Quality** - Implement thorough data cleaning and transformation processes to maintain accuracy and reliability
- **Enable Data Integration** - Combine multiple data sources (CRM and ERP) into a unified, user-friendly analytical model
- **Facilitate Analytics** - Provide a solid foundation for insightful reporting and data-driven decision-making
- **Document Best Practices** - Maintain clear, comprehensive documentation throughout the development process

## 🔄 ETL Process

The project implements a comprehensive **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** pipeline:

### Extract
Data is extracted from two primary sources:
- **CRM System** - Customer relationship management data
- **ERP System** - Enterprise resource planning data

### Transform
Raw data undergoes rigorous cleaning and transformation:
- Data validation and quality checks
- Standardization of formats and values
- Handling of null values and data inconsistencies
- Data type conversions and date formatting
- Business logic implementation

### Load
Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse with:
- Efficient loading strategies
- Data integrity maintenance
- Performance optimization

## 🗂️ Data Architecture

The warehouse implements a **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold) following modern data modelling principles:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Purpose** - Raw data ingestion and historical preservation
- **Content** - Unprocessed data from CRM and ERP systems
- **Format** - Data stored in its original format with minimal transformation
- **Benefits** - Complete audit trail and ability to reprocess data

### 🥈 Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
- **Purpose** - Data cleansing, validation, and standardization
- **Content** - Cleaned and conformed data ready for business logic
- **Transformations** - 
  - Data quality checks and corrections
  - Deduplication and standardization
  - Schema enforcement and type conversions
- **Benefits** - Reliable, validated data ready for business transformations

### 🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- **Purpose** - Analytics-ready dimensional models
- **Content** - Star schema design with fact and dimension tables
- **Features** -
  - Integrated CRM and ERP data
  - Business-level aggregations and calculations
  - Optimized for query performance
  - User-friendly structure for analysts and BI tools
- **Benefits** - Fast, efficient access for reporting and analytics

### Additional Architecture Features
- **Dimensional Modelling** - Star schema design for optimal query performance
- **Data Integration Layer** - Combines CRM and ERP data into cohesive data models
- **Scalability** - Built to accommodate growing data volumes and complexity
- **Incremental Loading** - Efficient data refresh strategies
